This Java exercise introduces an abstract class Forme representing geometric shapes, with concrete implementations for rectangles (Rectangle) and circles (Cercle). The abstract class provides common methods for setting coordinates, moving shapes, and defining abstract methods for calculating surface area and perimeter. The Principale class showcases the usage of these classes, creating instances of rectangles and circles and storing them in an ArrayList. This exercise serves as an educational exercise in object-oriented design and abstraction in Java.
